# HDFS Kerberos Tester
Use the HDFS Kerberos tester to troubleshoot HDFS Kerberos connections for PolyBase, when you experience HDFS Kerberos failure while creating an external table in a Kerberos secured HDFS cluster. 

This tool will assist in ruling out non-SQL Server issues, to help you concentrate on resolving HDFS Kerberos setup issues, namely identifying the following issues:
- Username/password misconfigurations
- Cluster Kerberos setup misconfigurations     

## Prerequisites
This tool is completely independent from SQL Server. It is available as a Jupyter Notebook, and requires:

- SQL Server 2016 RTM CU6 / SQL Server 2016 SP1 CU3 / SQL Server 2017 or higher with PolyBase installed
- A Hadoop cluster (Cloudera or Hortonworks) secured with Kerberos (Active Directory or MIT)
- [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download)
- Around 40 MB of hard disk space
