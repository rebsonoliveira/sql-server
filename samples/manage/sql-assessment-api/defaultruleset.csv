 When the Auto Update Statistics setting is ON, the Query Optimizer updates statistics when they are used by a query and when they might be out-of-date. Statistics become out-of-date after insert, update, delete, or merge operations change the data distribution in the table or indexed view. The Query Optimizer determines when statistics might be out-of-date by counting the number of data modifications since the last statistics update and comparing the number of modifications to a threshold. The threshold is based on the number of rows in the table or indexed view. The Query Optimizer checks for out-of-date statistics before compiling a query and before executing a cached query plan. Before compiling a query, the Query Optimizer uses the columns, tables, and indexed views in the query predicate to determine which statistics might be out-of-date. Before executing a cached query plan, the Database Engine verifies that the query plan references up-to-date statistics.
