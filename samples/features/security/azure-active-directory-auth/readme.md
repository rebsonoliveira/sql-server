## About this sample

<a name=before-you-begin></a>

## Before you begin

To run this sample, you need the following prerequisites:

**Software prerequisites:**

1. Visual Studio 2015 (or higher) with the latest SSDT installed (using .Net Framework 4.6 or higher)
	+ .Net Framework 4.6 must be set as the target framework for the Visual Studio project. To do this, double-click on Properties in Solution Explorer, then click the Application tab and check that the Target framework is set to .Net Framework 4.6
	+ To install .Net Framework 4.6, see https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/5a4x27ek.aspx
2. Active Directory Authentication Library for SQL Server (ADALSQL.DLL)
	+ ADALSQL.DLL enables applications to authenticate to Microsoft Azure SQL Database using Azure Active Directory. The ADALSQL.DLL is not installed with Visual Studio so download the DLL at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48742
	+ ADALSQL.DLL is automatically downloaded with Visual Studio 2015 Update 2, SQL Server Management Studio, and the newest version of SQL Server Data tools 

1. Create Azure Active Directory (AD),  or  federate your domain with existing Azure AD
     This allows either to use managed or federated accounts associated with a specific Azure AD
2. Create Azure AD administrator for Azure SQL DB using Azure portal, PowerShell command or Rest API 
3. With help from T-SQL query interface (i.e. SSMS query editor), using  Azure AD admin credentials for SQL DB & SQL DW, create an Azure AD user in a designated database. The database user represents your Azure AD principal (or one of the groups you belong to) and must exist in the database having CONNECT permission prior to executing a connection attempt 

 
**Other Prerequisites** 

1. For Azure AD integrated authentication a computer joined to a domain that is federated with Azure Active Directory is required
2. An existing database created before a connection attempt is required. The database can be created using credentials for SQL administrator, or Azure AD SQL administrator

## Sample details

This demo provides a simple tool for exploring Azure Active Directory authentication to Azure SQL DB or Azure SQL DW.

Azure Active Directory authentication with Azure SQL Database V12 supports the following authentication methods:
- User/password authentication  
- Integrated authentication 
- Application token authentication [Demo coming soon!]
