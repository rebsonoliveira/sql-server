## About this sample

The Token project contains a simple console application that connects to Azure SQL database using a self-signed certificate. 

**Software prerequisites:**


1. The `makecert.exe` utility, which is included in the Windows SDK 
	+ It is sometimes included in Visual Studio installations (depending on the selections made during installation). A search of your machine for `makecert.exe` would provide verification that the Windows SDK was installed. 
	+ If the Windows SDK was not installed, you may [download it here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/desktop/aa904949)
	+ You can learn more about the `makecert.exe` [utility here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa386968.aspx)
2. PowerShell with Azure Active Directory Module
	+ To download the latest PowerShell version [see this page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/powershell-install-configure/#Install) 
	+ [Install the Azure AD PowerShell Module](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/jj151815.aspx), if it is not already installed in your client machine.

## Run this sample

1.	Create an application account in Azure AD for your service.
	- Sign in to the Azure management portal.
	- Click on Azure Active Directory in the left hand navigation
	- Click the directory tenant where you wish to register the sample application. This must be the same directory that is associated with your database (the server hosting your database).
	- Click the Applications tab
	- In the drawer, click Add.
	- Click "Add an application my organization is developing".
	- Enter mytokentest as a friendly name for the application, select "Web Application and/or Web API", and click next.
	- Assuming this application is a daemon/service and not a web application, it doesn't have a sign-in URL or app ID URI. For these two fields, enter http://mytokentest
	- While still in the Azure portal, click the Configure tab of your application.
	- Find the Client ID value and copy it into a text editor, you will need this later when configuring your application ( i.e.  a4bbfe26-dbaa-4fec-8ef5-223d229f647d  /see the snapshot below/)

2. Logon to your Azure SQL Server’s user database as an Azure AD admin and using a T-SQL command provision a contained database user for your application principal:
	```sql
	CREATE USER [mytokentest] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER
	```
	- [See this link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sql-database-aad-authentication/) for more details on how to create an Azure Ad admin and a contained database user.

3. On the machine you are going to run the project on, generate and install a self-signed certificate. 
	- To complete this step, you will need to use `Makecert.exe` 
	- Open a command prompt window
	- Navigate to a folder where you want to generate a certificate file ( such as the folder where the demo files are) and change the following command for your environment 
	```
	<Windows SDK Path>\makecert.exe -r -pe -n "CN=Cert_name" -ss My -len 2048 Cert_name.cer
	```
	for example, like so: 
	```
	c:/"Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/8.1/bin/x64"/makecert -r -pe -n "CN=mytokentestCert" -ss My -len 2048 mytokentestCert.cer
	```
4. Add the certificate as a key for the application you created in Azure AD. 
	- Click the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell shortcut on desktop to open a Windows PowerShell workspace that has the Azure AD cmdlets. 
	- Copy the following code snippet to a text editor. 
	``` 
	connect-msolservice
	
	$cer = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate
	$cer.Import("<full path>\Cert_name.cer")
	$binCert = $cer.GetRawCertData()
	$credValue = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($binCert);
	New-MsolServicePrincipalCredential -AppPrincipalId "<client id>" -Type asymmetric -Value $credValue -Usage verify
	```
		+ Replace <full path> with the path to your certificate and Cert_name with your Certificate name that you used in step 3 above. 
		+ Replace <client id> with the client ID you copied in step 1.  
		+ Copy and paste your snippet into the powershell window and run it. 
	- The following command will verify that you added the certificate to your application's Active Directory Registration
	``` Get-MsolServicePrincipalCredential –ServicePrincipalName "URL"-ReturnKeyValues 0 ``` 

5. Configure the certificate and your application account in the *app.config* file in the project. 
	+ In Visual Studio, open *app.config* in the Solution Explorer
	![App.config file highlights](/samples/features/security/azure-active-directory-auth/img/app-config-key-value-example.png)
		- Find the app key `ida:Tenant` and replace the value with your AAD tenant name (your AAD domain)
		- Find the app key `ida:ClientID` and replace the value with the Client ID for the application registration from the Azure Portal (the value from step 1). 
		- Find the app key `ida:Cert_Name` and replace the value with the subject name (CN) of the self-signed certificate you created
		- For example: 
		```csharp
		<add key="ida:Tenant" value="cqclinic.onmicrosoft.com" />   //this is the AAD domain
	    	<add key="ida:ClientId" value="a4bbfe26-dbaa-4fec-8ef5-223d229f647d"/>  //this is the Client ID
    		<add key="ida:CertName" value="CN=mytokentestCert"/> //this is the Cert_name use by makecert.exe
		```
	+ In Visual Studio, open *Program.cs* in the Solution Explorer
	![Program.cs field highlights](/samples/features/security/azure-active-directory-auth/img/program-cs-builder-highlight.png)
		- Make the following changes: 
		```csharp
		    builder["Data Source"] = "aad-managed-demo.database.windows.net"; // replace with your server name
		    builder["Initial Catalog"] = "demo"; // replace with your database name
		```
6. Run the demo. (Click *Run* or press *F5*)
	+ A successful authorization should result in a message that states "Connected to the database" similar to the following:
