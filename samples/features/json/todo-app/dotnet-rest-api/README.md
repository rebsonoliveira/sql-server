# ASP.NET Core REST Web API that uses SQL/JSON functionalities 

This project contains an example implementation of ASP.NET Core REST API with CRUD operations on a simple Todo table. You can learn how to build REST API on the existing database schema using new JSON functionalities that are available in SQL Server 2016 (or higher) and Azure SQL Database.

## Run this sample

### Setup

1. From SQL Server Management Studio or Sql Server Data Tools connect to your SQL Server 2016 or Azure SQL database and execute setup.sql script that will create and populate Todo table in the database.

2. From Visual Studio 2015, open the **TodoRestWebApi.xproj** file from the root directory. Restore packages using right-click menu on the project in Visual Studio and by choosing Restore Packages item. As an alternative, you may run **dotnet restore** from the command line (from the root folder of application).

3. Add a connection string in appsettings.json or appsettings.development.json file. An example of the content of appsettings.development.json is shown in the following configuration:

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "TodoDb": "Server=.;Database=Todo;Integrated Security=true"
  }
}
```

If your database is hosted on Azure you can add something like:
```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "TodoDb": "Server=<<SERVER>>.database.windows.net;Database=Todo;User Id=<<USER>>;Password=<<PASSWORD>>"
  }
}
```

### Build and run the REST services

1. Build solution using Ctrl+Shift+B, right-click on project + Build, Build/Build Solution from menu, or **dotnet build** command from the command line (from the root folder of application).

2. Run sample app using F5 or Ctrl+F5,
  1. Open /api/Todo Url to get all Todo items as a JSON array,
  2. Open /api/Todo/1 Url to get details about a single Todo item with id 1,
  3. Send POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE Http requests to update content of Todo table.

## Sample details

This sample application shows how to create simple REST API service that performs CRUD operations on a simple Todo table.
ASP.NET Core Web API is used to implement REST Service in the example.
Service uses built-in JSON functionalities that are available in SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database.

## Disclaimers
The code included in this sample is not intended demonstrate some general guidance and architectural patterns for web development. It contains minimal code required to create REST API, and it does not use some patterns such as Repository. Sample uses built-in ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection mechanism; however, this is not prerequisite.
You can easily modify this code to fit the architecture of your application.
