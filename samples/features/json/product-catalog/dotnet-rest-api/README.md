## Run this sample

1. Create a database on SQL Server 2016 or Azure SQL Database and set compatibility level to 130.

2. From SQL Server Management Studio or Sql Server Data Tools connect to your SQL Server 2016 or Azure SQL database and execute [sql-scripts/setup.sql](sql-scripts/setup.sql) script that will create and populate Product table and create required stored procedures.

3. From Visual Studio 2015, open the **ProductCatalog.xproj** file from the root directory. Restore packages using right-click menu on the project in Visual Studio and by choosing Restore Packages item. As an alternative, you may run **dotnet restore** from the command line (from the root folder of application).


4. Add a connection string in appsettings.json or appsettings.development.json file. An example of the content of appsettings.development.json is shown in the following configuration:

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "ProductCatalog": "Server=.;Database=ProductCatalog;Integrated Security=true"
  }
}
```

If database is hosted on Azure you can add something like:
```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "ProductCatalog": "Server=<<SERVER>>.database.windows.net;Database=ProductCatalog;User Id=<<USER>>;Password=<<PASSWORD>>"
  }
}
```

5. Build solution using Ctrl+Shift+B, right-click on project + Build, Build/Build Solution from menu, or **dotnet build** command from the command line (from the root folder of application).

6. Run the sample app using F5 or Ctrl+F5 in Visual Studio 2015, or using **dotnet run** executed in the command prompt of the project root folder.  
  1. Open /api/Product Url to get all products from database,
  2. Open /api/Product/18 Url to get the product with id,
  3. Send POST Http request to /api/Product Url with JSON like {"Name":"Blade","Color":"Magenta","Price":18.0000,"Quantity":45} in the body of request to create new product,
  4. Send PUT Http request with JSON like {"Name":"Blade","Color":"Magenta","Price":18.0000,"Quantity":45} in the body of request to update the product with specified id,
  5. Send DELETE Http request /api/Product/18 Url to delete the product with specified id(18),

The code included in this sample is not intended demonstrate some general guidance and architectural patterns for web development. It contains minimal code required to create REST API, and it does not use some patterns such as Repository. Sample uses built-in ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection mechanism; however, this is not prerequisite.
You can easily modify this code to fit the architecture of your application.
