# ASP.NET Core REST Web API that uses SQL/JSON functionalities 

This project contains an implementation of ASP.NET Core REST API backend for [ReactJS Comments tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html).
In this example you will see how easily you can integrate Single-page apps implemented using ReactJS with SQL Server 2016 or Azure SQL Database using ASP.NET Core and JSON functions that are available in SQL Server 2016.

## Before you begin

To run this sample, you need the following prerequisites.

**Software prerequisites:**

1. SQL Server 2016 (or higher) or an Azure SQL Database
2. Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 (or higher) or Visual Studio Code Editor with the ASP.NET Core 1.0 (or higher)

**Azure prerequisites:**

1. Permission to create an Azure SQL Database

## Run this sample

1. Create a database on SQL Server 2016 or Azure SQL Database.

2. From SQL Server Management Studio or Sql Server Data Tools connect to your SQL Server 2016 or Azure SQL database and execute [sql-scripts/setup.sql](sql-scripts/setup.sql) script that will create and populate Comments table.

3. From Visual Studio 2015, open the **CommentsReactApp.xproj** file from the root directory. Restore packages using right-click menu on the project in Visual Studio and by choosing Restore Packages item. As an alternative, you may run **dotnet restore** from the command line (from the root folder of application).

4. Add a connection string in appsettings.json or appsettings.development.json file. An example of the content of appsettings.development.json is shown in the following configuration:

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "CommentsDb": "Server=.;Database=CommentsDb;Integrated Security=true"
  }
}
```

If your database is hosted on Azure you can add something like:
```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "CommentsDb": "Server=<<SERVER>>.database.windows.net;Database=CommentsDb;User Id=<<USER>>;Password=<<PASSWORD>>"
  }
}
```

### Build and run sample

1. Run the sample app using F5 or Ctrl+F5 in Visual Studio 2015, or using **dotnet run** executed in the command prompt of the project root folder.  
  1. Open /index.html Url to get all comments from database,
  2. Add new comment using the form below the list of comments.

## Sample details

This sample application shows how to create REST API service is used as beckend for ReactJS app.
Front-end code stored in wwwroot folder is **unmodified** Facebook's [ReactJS sample comments app](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html).
ASP.NET Core Web API is used to implement REST Service called by Comments front-end app.
Service uses FOR JSON clause that is available in SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database.

## Disclaimers
The code included in this sample is not intended demonstrate some general guidance and architectural patterns for web development. It contains minimal code required to create REST API, and it does not use some patterns such as Repository. Sample uses built-in ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection mechanism; however, this is not prerequisite.
You can easily modify this code to fit the architecture of your application.
