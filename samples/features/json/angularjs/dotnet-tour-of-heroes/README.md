# Angular Heroes ASP.NET Core REST Web App

This project contains an implementation of [AngularJS Heroes sample app](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/) implemented using ASP.NET Core REST API backend that use SQL/JSON functionalities.
AngularJs code is modified version of johnpapa [Github sample project](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular2-tour-of-heroes). 
In this example you will see how easily you can integrate Single-page apps implemented using Angular JS with SQL Server 2016 or Azure SQL Database using ASP.NET Core and JSON functions.

## Get this sample

Sample project is placed on SQL Server GitHub repository. You can clone or download repository and locate code 
in samples/features/json/angularjs/dotnet-tour-of-heroes folder.

If you want to clone only this sample (without other samples), run the following commands from Git Bash:

```
git clone -n https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples sql-server-samples
cd sql-server-samples
git config core.sparsecheckout true
echo "samples/features/json/angularjs/dotnet-tour-of-heroes/*" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
git checkout
```

Or you can use the following PowerShell script:
```
git clone -n https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples .\sql-server-samples

## Run this sample

1. Create a database on SQL Server 2016 or Azure SQL Database.

2. From SQL Server Management Studio or Sql Server Data Tools connect to your SQL Server 2016 or Azure SQL database and execute [sql-scripts/setup.sql](sql-scripts/setup.sql) script that will create and populate **Hero** table.

3. Add a connection string in appsettings.json or appsettings.development.json file. An example of the content of appsettings.development.json is shown in the following configuration:

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "HeroDb": "Server=.;Database=HeroDb;Integrated Security=true"
  }
}
```

If your database is hosted on Azure you can add something like:
```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "HeroDb": "Server=<<SERVER>>.database.windows.net;Database=HeroDb;User Id=<<USER>>;Password=<<PASSWORD>>"
  }
}
```

### Build and run sample

1. Restore NugetPackages using **dotnet restore** command.
2. Restore npm packages using **npm install** command lines. This command will download packages in **node_modules** folder.
3. Build project using **dotnet build** command executed from command line (from project root folder) or using Visual Studio 2017. 
4. Run the sample app using **dotnet run** executed in the command prompt of the project root folder.  

Sequence of commands is:
```
npm install
dotnet restore
