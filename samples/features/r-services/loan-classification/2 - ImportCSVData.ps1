Description: 
    1. First step is to use Lending Club CSV files and import them into an in-memory staging table
    2. Second step is to transform the staging data and move them into the table which will be used for the predictions

# Get a list of all the CSV files in the folder
$files = ls C:\Tiger\Extract\*.csv # TODO: Change the path to the appropriate location of the CSV files


# Create a function to import the CSV data by skipping the first line
# You will see a number of Invoke-SqlCmd failures for rows that are not being imported into the database
function ImportData ($csvFile)
