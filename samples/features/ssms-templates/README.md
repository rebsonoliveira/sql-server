# SSMS Query Templates

SQL Server Management Studio supports templatized queries for multiple languages, including T-SQL, DAX, and MDX. The templates contain variables of the form "<variable_name, [data type], [default value]>". SSMS users typically open the templates in one of the following ways:

1. The Template Explorer, which presents the hierarchy as a tree control. Users can drag the query templates to the current editor window or double click to open them in a new window.
2. A "New <object>" menu item in Object Explorer. 
3. The File/Open menu to open their own templates. 

The SSMS query editor detects the presence of these variables and offers a menu item to open the dialog to specify values for the template parameters.

These templates are offered for anyone to download and customize for their own use. Community contributions back to the master branch are welcomed. Approved contributions may be picked up for installation with future versions of SSMS.
