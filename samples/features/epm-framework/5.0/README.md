We are also providing a set of scripts as an extension to the base set of Microsoft provided policies, and assumes the user has previously imported these Microsoft provided policies, as described by the "Configure/Create Policies and Centralize on the Central Management Server" section of the EPM Configuration Documentation.
These scripts have some fixes for the Microsoft provided policies, and include extra policies: 
- Determining the if SQL Server instances are at the recommended SP level. Note that the condition has to be updated with proper build numbers for the policy to be current. 
- Determining the if SQL Server instances are at the recommended CU or Hotfix. Note that the condition has to be updated with proper build numbers for the policy to be current.
- Do I have log backups older than 24h?
- Do I have full backups on read-write, full RM databases?
- The Service accounts must not match between the several services, so what is the current status?
- Is AutoUpdateStats Disabled and AutoUpdateStats Async Enabled? Using SSMS gives you no warning if you’ve enabled this scenario, but if you think you are using * AutoUpdateStats Async, guess again.
- Check for database status that prevent database access, like Emergency mode or Suspect.
- Are there Non-unique clustered indexes? This might be something you wouldn’t want as a rule-of thumb.
- Are there tables with non-clustered IXs but no clustered IX? This might hint you to evaluate your application query activity against heaps.
- Do I have log growth in percentage, and it’s already over 1GB?
- Do I have more VLFs than my rule-of-thumb? This has a 100 VLF threshold – change as appropriate.
- Am I using Enterprise SKU features? Maybe I need to move a database to another server, and if it’s not an Enterprise Edition, so I must account for this?
- Is Maximum Server Memory set at default? You will want to set this setting different from default.
- Is Server Memory set at a fixed value? 
- Are DB Compatibility levels same as engine version?
- Is Tempdb number of files appropriate? Regarding number of schedulers and if is multiple of 4?
- Do TempDB data file sizes match?
- Is MaxDOP setting at the recommended value?
