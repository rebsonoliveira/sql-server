## Run this sample

1. Create a database on SQL Server 2016 or Azure SQL Database and set compatibility level to 130.

2. From SQL Server Management Studio or Visual Studio/Sql Server Data Tools connect to your SQL Server 2016 or Azure SQL database and execute setup.sql script that will create and populate Product table and create required stored procedures.

3. Build the project - Open command prompt in project root folder (the folder that contains project json), and run following commands: **dotnet restore** to take all necessary NuGet packages, **dotnet build** to build the project. As an alternative, open the **ProductCatalog.xproj** file from the root directory using Visual Studio 2015 U3. Restore packages using right-click menu on the project in Visual Studio and by choosing Restore Packages item.

4. Add connection string in appsettings.json or appsettings.development.json file. An example of the content of appsettings.development.json is shown in the followin configuration:

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "ProductCatalog": "Server=.;Database=ProductCatalog;Integrated Security=true"
  }
}
```

If database is hosted on Azure you can add something like:
```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "ProductCatalog": "Server=<<SERVER>>.database.windows.net;Database=ProductCatalog;User Id=<<USER>>;Password=<<PASSWORD>>"
  }
}
```

5. Build solution using Ctrl+Shift+B, right-click on project + Build, Build/Build Solution from menu, or **dotnet build** command from the command line (from the root folder of application).

6. Run the sample app using F5 or Ctrl+F5 in Visual Studio 2015, or using **dotnet run** executed in the command prompt of the project root folder.  
  1. Open /index.html Url to get all products from database,
  2. Use expand buttons to see history of products,
  3. Restore some of the previous version using restore link,
  4. Use Slider to go back in time.

## Sample details

This sample application shows how to display list of products, go into any point in time in history, see full history of changes, or restore previous versions of products.
Front-end code is implemented using JQuery/JQuery UI libraries, and JQuery DataTable component for displaying data.
Server-side code is implemented using ASP.NET Core Web API.
SQL Server Temporal feature is used to store and query product information. SQL Server JSON functions are used to format product data that will be sent to front-end page.
